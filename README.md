<h1 align="center">CE40324-MIR üëã</h1>
<h2 align="center">Phase 1</h2>

A modern information retreival system, works on English & Persian languages. Using Proximity Search and TF-IDF Search, Error Correction, Indexing and Compressing methods.

<h2 align="center">Phase 2</h2>

Implementing Classifying Algorithms such as Naive Bayes, K-NN, SVM and Random Forest. Compare these methods on different aspects to see which one does better on text data. Improve MIR Systetm in phase 1 via using these methods.

## Getting Started

To run this project on your local machine:
* [Clone](https://github.com/NimaFathi/CE40324-MIR.git)
*[Install Requirements using pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)
*[Run main.py] - run main.py in each phase 

### Prerequisites

we used different python libraries in this project, the most important requirements listed below:
```
numpy
sklearn
nltk
hazm
matplotlib
seaborn
```

## Features

# phase 1

*[Cleaning Query]
*[Removing StopWords]
*[Error Correction in Query]
*[TF-IDF Search]
*[Proximity Search]

As I explained above you should use main.py in phase1/main.py, then run it , that is a simple GUI like below:

### TF-IDF Search

![TF-IDF](https://github.com/NimaFathi/CE40324-MIR/blob/master/static_files/mir1.png)

### Proximity search

![Proximity](https://github.com/NimaFathi/CE40324-MIR/blob/master/static_files/mir1.png)

# phase 2

*[Naiive Bayse classifier]
*[K-NN]
*[SVM (soft version)
*[Random Forest]]
*[Multiple Evaluation on Methods]
*[TF-IDF Using Classifiers]

### Navigation

See list of files below and what do they peresents:


```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
