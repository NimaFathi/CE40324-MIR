## Getting Started

To run this project on your local machine:
* [Clone](https://github.com/NimaFathi/CE40324-MIR.git) <br>
* [Install Requirements using pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)<br>
* Run main.py - run main.py in each phase  

### Prerequisites

we used different python libraries in this project, the most important requirements listed below:
```
numpy
sklearn
nltk
hazm
matplotlib
seaborn
```

## Features

### phase 1

* Cleaning Query <br>
* Removing StopWords <br>
* Error Correction in Query <br>
* TF-IDF Search <br>
* Proximity Search

As I explained above you should use main.py in phase1/main.py, then run it , that is a simple GUI like below:

### TF-IDF Search

### phase 2
You can see persian documentation in this [Link](https://mirteam.slite.com/api/s/note/Ug2ZuzBRyne6Fc8xZams7V/bazyaby-pyshrfth-atalaaat)

* Naiive Bayse classifier
* K-NN
* SVM (soft version)
* Random Forest
* Multiple Evaluation on Methods
* TF-IDF Using Classifiers

### Naive Bayes 
Run F1, Accuracy, Precision, Recall evaluating parameters.

### Navigation

See list of files below and what do they peresents:


```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
